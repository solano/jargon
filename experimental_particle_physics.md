- **Acceptance**: fraction of events that are detected. In general, only the product of acceptance
and efficiency is well-defined. While b-tagging efficiency may refer to the fraction of detected
b jets that are b-tagged, b jet acceptance refers to how many b jets are detected in the first place.

- **CLs formalism**: [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLs_method_(particle_physics)) to
produce exclusion limits containing the value zero.

- **Control region**: region of experimental parameter space that is similar, but not quite equal
to the signal region, commonly used for estimating backgrounds. Example: if the signal region has
two opposite-sign (OS) muons, the control region could be composed of same-sign (SS) muons, or of
a muon and an electron, and so on.

- **Data**: experimental data (not Monte Carlo).

- **Data-driven**: a background or something about it is estimated in a data-driven way if it is not
estimated directly from Monte Carlo, but rather from the data themselves.

- **Efficiency**: ratio of "successes" over number of "tries". For example, the b-tagging efficiency
is the fraction of b jets that are b-tagged. See also **acceptance**.

- **Exclusion limit**: could be understood as a one-sided confidence interval, i.e. one that places
an upper or lower limit on an observable. In practice is used with the CLs formalism that does not,
strictly speaking, produce confidence intervals.

- **Loose**: a loose particle does not meet all selection criteria for its species. For example,
you may consider that only electrons with $|\eta| \le 2.0$ are to be considered in your analysis, in
which case an electron that meets all other criteria for electrons but has $|\eta| > 2.0$ is a
loose electron. Loose particles are used as control regions. See **tight**.

- **Pileup**, **pile-up**, **PU**: PU 50 means that 50 collisions are recorded at once, while
only one is used for analysis. Large PU complicates reconstructions.

- **Reconstructed**, **reconstruction**: some aspect of a particle collision that has been inferred
from data. For example: an electron is reconstructed from data in the tracking system and the EM
calorimeter using the particle-flow algorithm.

- **Scale factor**: normalization factor of a distribution whose shape is known. Example usage: a
data-driven scale factor derived from a control region.

- **Signal over background** or **S/B**: number of signal events over number of background events
in a given signal region.

- **Signal region**: region of experimental parameter space chosen for analysis. The choice of signal
region is a compromise between number of events and S/B. See **control region**.

- **Signal strength** or **signal strength modifier**: noted $\mu$, is the ratio of observed number
of events to predicted number of events from the Standard Model. This is a simple way of quantifying
deviation from the SM, since the expected value of $\mu$ is always 1.

- **Significance**: p-value, expressed in standard deviations away from the mean of a 1-D Gaussian
distribution. A $5\sigma$ significance (threshold for discovery) means a p-value of $3\times 10^{-7}$.

- **Statistics**, as in **accumulate statistics**: (experimental) data.

- **Tight**: a particle is considered tight if it meets all selection criteria for its species.
See **loose**.

- **Yield** or **data yield**: number of observed events.
